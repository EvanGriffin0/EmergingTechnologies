    "\n",
    "Given four Boolean inputs and one Boolean output, the task is to generate a function that is either constant (always the same output) or balanced (outputs True for exactly half of all possible inputs). The function must be randomly chosen from all such valid functions and returned as a callable."

    "A Boolean function maps a set of Boolean inputs to a single Boolean output. A function is *constant* if it always returns the same value (always True or always False), regardless of input. A function is *balanced* if it returns True for exactly half of all possible input combinations and False for the other half. Distinguishing between constant and balanced functions is central to the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, as quantum algorithms can determine this global property with fewer queries than classical approaches."

For a balanced function, we randomly select exactly 8 of the 16 inputs to map to True, with the remainder mapping to False; this mapping can be stored as a set or lookup table. The function will be returned as a callable f(a, b, c, d) constructed from the chosen mapping."
