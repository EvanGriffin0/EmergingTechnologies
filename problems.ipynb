The function must be randomly chosen from all such valid functions and returned as a callable."

A function is *balanced* if it returns True for exactly half of all possible input combinations and False for the other half. Distinguishing between constant and balanced functions is central to the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm, as quantum algorithms can determine this global property with fewer queries than classical approaches."
